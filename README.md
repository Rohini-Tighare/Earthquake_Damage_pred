# Earthquake_Damage_pred
The earthquake damage prediction classification model is a machine learning algorithm designed to assess potential damage levels caused by earthquakes. It uses features like earthquake magnitude, building type, and local conditions to classify damage severity.

The dataset used for training contains earthquake-related information, including factors like earthquake details, building characteristics, and historical damage reports. This labeled dataset helps the model learn to predict damage levels accurately. The model's predictions assist in prioritizing response efforts and resource allocation during earthquake events. Keep in mind that the effectiveness of the model relies on the quality and relevance of the data used for training.
Used to Predict Earthquake Damage on Infrastructure and Buildings.
Achieved accuracy of 85.15% using Random Forest.
From this Project By Predicting the Damage we can allocate resources for response and recovery efforts
